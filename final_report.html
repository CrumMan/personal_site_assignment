        <h1 class="subject"> The decisions and story of My final project</h1>
        <h2 class="subject"> JT Pyle, WDD 130, 3/29/23</h2>
        <h3 class="subject">The Subject</h3>
        <p >The Subject of my website was to create an Ecomerce page to the average person.</p>
        <h3 class="subject">Audience</h3>
        <p >People like my friend who brought this idea to my mind that would consider me as a contractor for them.</p>
        <h3 class="subject">Goals/Objectives</h3>
        <p >At first my goal was to make a website for my friend. He was really wanting to open up a business and 
            this would give him a head start. Instead of handing me things he wanted in his site and photos to 
            include he decided to give me a vision of what he wanted it to look like than he said "Okay make it
            and if I like it we will change the photos words of logo on your website. After that for me my goal 
            was to Make a great looking site, wanted I feel I did excactly that. as I grow in potential with writing 
            code I will make the website better and I will use it as a resume with businesses to get jobs and to test features for my future websites that will change the world.</p>
        <h3 class="subject"> Design Process</h3>
        <p>Like all design processes my website started as an Idea that I wanted to create, after that it progressed to fit new ideas 
            that I could see myself do. I for example in my first home page thought "I want to try XY and Z" and twelve hours I made it all happen.
            After that I noticed I was still having problems making a general card so three hours later I made one after I drew out in a wireframe how I wanted it to be.
            I than realized I was by no means done when testing my site so I chose to properly align my paper in the home screen as I learned things. It all was a process and I liked it that way.
            After Our story was made I started showing friends including my friend that wanted to start a business. He was intrested in my growing skill and wanted to see what more I could do.
            I than learned about lists and how to make forms. I than thought about it and decided to make a form that would be coded in a function to send emails to the company. I made a page for this cause it would be linked to a payment system.
            I showed some friends that and they were amazed with how much I had came. I realized, this is simple stuff to do it just takes dedication. I than worked on validating my code for errors and the website was complete.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subject"> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            I realize that this personal site gave me a road map to learning to create a simple website. It is going to help me further my education in web development and software engineering. I will be able to continue to learn how to be a front end developer and this is just the first website I have made for that job and carreer.
