        <h1 class="subject"> The decisions and story of My final project</h1>
        <h2 class="subject"> JT Pyle, WDD 130, 3/29/23</h2>
        <h3 class="subject">The Subject</h3>
        <p >The Subject of my website was to create an Ecomerce page to showcase my skills to businesses.</p>
        <h3 class="subject">Audience</h3>
        <p >People like my friend who brought this idea to my mind that would consider me as a contractor for them. I styled the wording as if it was a fitness ecommerse website.</p>
        <h3 class="subject">Goals/Objectives</h3>
        <p >At first my goal was to make a website for my friend. He was really wanting to open up a business and 
            this would give him a head start. Instead of handing me things he wanted in his site and photos to 
            include he decided to give me a vision of what he wanted it to look like than he said "Okay make it
            and if I like it we will change the photos words of logo on your website. After that for me my goal 
            was to Make a great looking site, wanted I feel I did excactly that. as I grow in potential with writing 
            code I will make the website better and I will use it as a resume with businesses to get jobs and to test features for my future websites that will change the world.</p>
        <h3 class="subject"> Design Process</h3>
        <p>Like all design processes my website started as an Idea that I wanted to create, after that it progressed to fit new ideas 
            that I could see myself do. I for example in my first home page thought "I want to try XY and Z" the process for all my pages were as such. I envisoned a website and what I wanted it to look like. Than I made all the HTML and elements for the page. I than
            made the css and edited the HTML to work with the CSS. After that you take all the pages you just wrote code into and you edit and validate it.
            The first homepage took a little under two hours but cause I only had little practice with css the css portion took twelve hours I made it all happen. I consistantly as I learned would open up my webpage and change it to make it look better.
            After that I noticed I was still having problems making a general greeting card so three hours later I made one after I drew out in a wireframe how I wanted it to be.
            I than realized I was by no means done when testing my site so I chose to properly align my orginization in the home screen as I learned things. It all was a process and I liked it that way.
            After Our story was made I started showing friends including my friend that wanted to start a business. He was intrested in my growing skill and wanted to see what more I could do.
            I than learned about lists and how to make forms. I than thought about it and decided to make a form that would be coded in a function to send emails to the company. I made a page for this cause it would be linked to a payment system.
            I showed some friends that and they were amazed with how much I had came. I realized, this is simple stuff to do it just takes dedication. I than worked on validating my code for errors and the website was complete.
        </p>
        <p> Another note: This webpage I wanted to make to look like a simple article. I wrote it out my HTML than my css, I than compared it to the average website and I realized I liked its set up. I edited it a little more to make my wording seem better than I was done.</p>
        <h3 class="subject"> Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            I realize that this personal site gave me a road map to learning to create a simple website. It is going to help me further my education in web development and software engineering. I will be able to continue to learn how to be a front end developer and this is just the first website I have made for that job and carreer. My father may employ me while im in college to make a business he wants to create and I want to make a social media platform. This is definately the beginning of a skill that I will be using all throughout my life.
