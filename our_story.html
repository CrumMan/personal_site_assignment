        Fit Dont Quit's idea started when I was a three-hundred pound fat man. I constantly ate calories up in the 4000 range daily.
        I than tried a series of diets and I found that temporarly I could lose weight. The moment I would stop the diet I would again
        gain back the weight I lost. My body was practically a fat gainer and I kept packing. I couldnt run and I kept seeing women I was 
        attracted to not being remotley intrested in me. I have seen myself as a good looking individual but I realized that there was an aspect 
        that was holding me back from meeting my future wife. I one day decided to shave my face and the aspect that was not their was staring at me,
        My stomach, my fat face, and  Fat heart so I talked to our co-owner Dan who was a physical trainer. He gave me workouts and gave me a diet plan 
        thoughtfully planned a diet for me and weight started to melt off my body consistantly for eight months I lost roughly 60 pounds. I knew then that there was
        a reason why I lost so much weight. I talked with dan and together we created a business mergeing our strengths. It is all centered around by my genetic ancestors. 
        with Fit Dont Quit we have helped hundreds of people lose a large amount of body fat.
