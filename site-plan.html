        Fit Dont Quit, It isn't easy but it is worth it
        <br><br>
        Testimonial: I thought I was "big boned" after I took some tests to find my bone density and saw 
        that my body had two times the bone density of the average person. I weighed 260 pounds and hit 
        the gym every day to get stronger but one thing happened that happens to heavy power lifters. 
        I got hurt when some of my equipment failed and I had to bail the weight, The first day was painful 
        and I had to deal with a nasty pull in my back that sent a surge of pain into my leg any time I
        moved and was soon diagnosed with sciatica and it is known people with this problem rarely get rid of it.
        I decided to get another job that was more physical but had free food as a benefit cause eat was all I could do. 
        I gained ten pounds at the free buffet and was bigger than I had ever been weighing in at 280 pounds. 
        <br>     Than I found Fit Don't quit and I was instructed to go on a diet that highlighted the keto Diet and encouraged 
        me to work harder daily. It was hard but I kept at it. After six months I had lost sixty five pounds and 
        I can say now, even though the pain from that injury is still there I can run a mile and lift fifty pounds
        of material consistantly daily without further pain. Other than the pain from my sciatica which has been brought to a minimal,
         I can say ive never felt more powerful and healthy.

      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
        Fit Dont Quit's idea started when I was a three-hundred pound fat man. I constantly ate calories up in the 4000 range daily.
        I than tried a series of diets and I found that temporarly I could lose weight. The moment I would stop the diet I would again
        gain back the weight I lost. My body was practically a fat gainer and I kept packing. I couldnt run and I kept seeing women I was 
        attracted to not being remotley intrested in me. I have seen myself as a good looking individual but I realized that there was an aspect 
        that was holding me back from meeting my future wife. I one day decided to shave my face and the aspect that was not their was staring at me,
        My stomach, my fat face, and  Fat heart so I talked to our co-owner Dan who was a physical trainer. He gave me workouts and gave me a diet plan 
        thoughtfully planned a diet for me and weight started to melt off my body consistantly for eight months I lost roughly 60 pounds. I knew then that there was
        a reason why I lost so much weight. I talked with dan and together we created a business mergeing our strengths. It is all centered around by my genetic ancestors. 
        with Fit Dont Quit we have helped hundreds of people lose a large amount of body fat.
