                <p>
                     I thought I was "big boned" after I took some tests to find my bone density and saw 
             my body had two times the bone density of the average person. I weighed 260 pounds and hit 
            the gym every day to get stronger but one thing happened that happens to heavy power lifters. 
            I got hurt when some of my equipment failed and I had to bail the weight, The first day was painful 
            and I had to deal with a nasty pull in my back that sent a surge of pain into my leg any time I
            moved and was soon diagnosed with sciatica and it is known people with this problem rarely get rid of it.
            I decided to get another job that was more physical but had free food as a benefit cause eat was all I could do. 
            I gained ten pounds at the free buffet and was bigger than I had ever been weighing in at 280 pounds. 
            </p>
                <p>
                Than I found Fit Don't quit and I was instructed to go on a diet that highlighted the keto Diet and encouraged 
            me to work harder daily. It was hard but I kept at it. After six months I had lost sixty five pounds and 
            I can say now, even though the pain from that injury is still there I can run a mile and lift fifty pounds
            of material consistantly daily without further pain. Other than the pain from my sciatica which has been brought to a minimal,
            I can say ive never felt more powerful and healthy.
